# üß† Performance Analysis Report: Multithreaded Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## üìå 1. Objective

To implement and analyze task parallelism using **multithreading in Python** for fundamental algorithms: **Linear Search** and **Merge Sort**.
The aim is to evaluate performance improvements through parallel execution and understand the practical limitations of Python's threading model for **CPU-bound tasks**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Problem Description

This study investigates whether multithreading can provide performance benefits for computational tasks involving array searching and sorting.
The challenge lies in Python's **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**, which restricts true parallel execution of CPU-bound tasks.

**Key Focus Areas:**

* Measuring execution time differences between single-threaded and multithreaded implementations
* Analyzing how array size affects performance gains
* Evaluating the overhead of thread management versus computational benefits

* **Linear Search:** Sequential search algorithm with *O(n)* complexity
* **Merge Sort:** Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with *O(n log n)* complexity

### **Approaches**

* **Single-threaded:** Sequential execution within one thread
* **Multithreaded:** Parallel execution using `threading` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`

### **Technical Specifications**

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `threading`, `concurrent.futures`, `time`, `random`
* **Thread Configuration:**

### üîç Key Observations

#### **Linear Search Performance**

* **Small arrays (1,000):** Multithreading introduced overhead (0.001333s vs 0.000000s)
* **Medium arrays (10,000):** Single-threaded remained superior (0.000000s vs 0.010421s)
* **Large arrays (100,000):** Single-threaded maintained advantage (0.005257s vs 0.008247s)

#### **Merge Sort Performance**

* **Small arrays (1,000):** Multithreading was 4.5√ó slower due to thread management overhead
* **Medium arrays (10,000):** Slight performance gain (1.06√ó speedup)
* **Large arrays (100,000):** Noticeable performance benefit (1.13√ó speedup)

## üß† 6. Discussion

### **Thread Overhead vs Computational Gain**

For small datasets, thread management overhead outweighs the benefits.
As dataset size grows, computational work becomes substantial enough to justify threading costs.

### **Python GIL Limitations**

Multithreaded Linear Search shows minimal benefit due to the **GIL**, which restricts true parallel CPU execution.
Threads compete for interpreter control, negating potential performance gains.

### **Algorithm-Specific Behavior**

**Merge Sort** benefits more from multithreading due to its divide-and-conquer design ‚Äî
independent subarrays allow partial parallelism with minimal contention.

## üèÅ 7. Conclusion

The effectiveness of **multithreading in Python** for CPU-bound tasks depends on several factors:

1. **Algorithm Characteristics** ‚Äì Divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort) benefit most.
2. **Data Size** ‚Äì Gains appear for larger datasets (‚â•10,000 elements).
3. **Python‚Äôs GIL Impact** ‚Äì Limits benefits for CPU-bound, non-I/O tasks.
4. **Optimal Use Cases:**

   * Large-scale sorting (100,000+ elements)
   * Algorithms with natural parallelism
   * Mixed workloads with I/O operations

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For smaller datasets or simple sequential algorithms, **single-threaded implementations remain more efficient** due to reduced overhead and GIL constraints.
